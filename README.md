This game was inspired by old good Win Sapper Game and entitled as "Number Sapper Game". The main idea of this game is to guess the numbers which are cells with bombs. The list of these cells are generated randomly at the beggining of the game after the gaming mode choice, and the gamer's task is to input the numbers in the range. If the gamer guess all numbers - it is the win scenario, if he guess at least one - he wooden, which means semi-win scenario, if there are no guessed numbers in a gamer'a set - it is the lose scenario and game is over. There are 3 gaming modes: light (guess 3 numbers from the 10), normal (guess 4 numbers from the 15) and nightmare (guess 5 numbers from the 20). The gaming mode is made by the gamer at the beginning of the game.
